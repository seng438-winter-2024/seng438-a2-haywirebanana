# 1 Introduction

In this lab, our group was introduced to automating tests using JUnit on the Eclipse IDE. We were tasked and given a software program (“JFreeChart”) to test and write JUnit tests while ensuring we followed Javadoc requirements. We specifically tested two classes, the org.jfree.data.Range class and the org.jfree.data.DataUtilities class, making sure that we are to test 5 methods from each class. The objective of this lab was to learn and get familiar with creating test cases, implementing mock objects, and executing them. 
We aimed to identify bugs throughout different versions of the JAR program. This involved us learning how to use the Eclipse IDE effectively, making sure our JUnit tests follow the Javadoc set requirements, and successfully executing our mock objects. This lab is great in simulating a real-world industry example of a problem a company could have in regards to software another dev built that needs to be tested. By having to resort to the documentation to come up with the requirements needed to be satisfied in the test suite we incorporate the skills we learned from the first lab in needing to identify potential problems a code base could have.

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
